Each max function costs n operation time, and since there are four max
functions, it would cost 4n operation time. The big O for this is O(n).

List "a" items are transferred to temp_list -> n
temp_list is sorted -> nlogn
For loop runs n//3 times -> n//3
The big O for this is O(n + nlogn + n//3)
Simplifies to O(nlogn)

List "a" items are transferred to temp_list -> n
temp_list is sorted, costing nlogn operation time -> nlogn
For loop runs n times -> n
The big O for this is O(n + nlogn + n)
Simplifies to O(nlogn)

List "a" items are transferred to temp_list -> n
temp_list is sorted -> nlogn
For loop runs n times -> n
Nested while loop runs n times -> n
The two loops together  -> n*n = n2
The big O for this is O(n + nlogn + n2)
Simplifies to O(n2).
